		<h1>Shoko Server - Integrity Tab</h1>
		<p>The Integrity Tab checks the hash values of the files in your collection against their original hash value when
			first imported to detect corrupted files.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>A <strong>Integrity Check</strong> allows you to scan your <strong>Import Folders</strong> for possible file
					corruption. Any Import Folders you add to a <strong>Integrity Check</strong> will have their files rehashed
					with the new value compared to the original value stored in your database from when the file was first
					imported. Files that have the <strong>same hash value</strong> pass and are not marked as corrupted, however
					files that <strong>do not have the same hash value</strong> are marked as corrupted and displayed in the
					results panel below. With this utility you can replace corrupted files in your collection preventing playback
					errors from happening in the future.</p>
