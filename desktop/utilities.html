								<p>When importing your files to build your collection, any file that Shoko Server is unable to find on AniDB (by matching hashes) will be listed in
										the unrecognized tab. Keep in mind that just because a file is listed as unrecognized, it does not always mean a record for that series,
										episode, movie or special does not exist on AniDB. It simply means that that the version or file you have in your collection is not known to
										AniDB.</p>
								<p>There are a various reasons as to why your file ended up in the unrecognized list, they usually all fit into
										one of the following groups.</p>
								<ul>
										<li>Unknown Release</li>
										<li>Error When Hashing</li>
										<li>Corrupted File</li>
										<li>Not a Video File</li>
								</ul>
								<p>It’s important to note that a corrupted file does not mean a broken file, in other words just because a file is corrupt it does not mean the file
										has playback issues. What usually happens is the copy you downloaded has slight variations from the official source which results in the
										CRC32 hash value and hash being different which is why the file is unrecognized. If this is the case then <strong>you should not submit your
												file to AniDB </strong> as it will be rejected, instead it needs to be Manually Linked. If the file has never been submitted before
										then there will be nothing to check against which is why the file is unrecognized. You can submit the file to AniDB using AVDump2 which will
										add the file which will benefit all users of Shoko. To check, simply navigate to the episode on AniDB to which the file corresponds too and
										look for an entry form the release group you have, if it's there then the file you have is corrupted, if it's not then you can add it.</p>
