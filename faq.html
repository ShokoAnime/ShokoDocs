										<div class="panel-body">
												<p>We want to make something very clear, using Shoko <strong>will not</strong> get you <strong>permanently banned</strong> from AniDB. Shoko uses the
														official AniDB api and complies with all rules and guidelines for using it.
												</p>
												<p>The “banned” message you’re seeing is simply telling you that you’ve been <strong>temporarily</strong> banned for excessive connection attempts. AniDB
														will sometimes temporarily ban a user if it thinks you are attempting to leech data. by making excessive connection attempts that’s usually in the range
														of a couple hundred attempts in a very short period of time, the algorithm used by AniDB will come to the conclusion that you are leeching data and
														temporarily ban you. in reality you’ve done nothing wrong and just need to wait out the ban which can last anywhere from 10 minutes to 24 hours
														depending on the severity. also keep in mind that browsing AniDB while Shoko is scraping and downloading data can also increase the chance of getting a
														temporary ban as your creating more connection attempts.
												</p>
												<p>If you find yourself with a temporary ban, you should not attempt to perform any scraping or updating of AniDB data for at least 15 minutes just to be
														sure you don’t get temporarily banned again for what looks like a repeated attempt at data leeching. after 15 minutes you can try again and if you are
														still temporarily banned then you'll need to wait a couple hours. also it's import to understand that changing your ip address to circumvent a temporary
														ban can lead to a permanent ban for forceful manipulation.

										<div class="panel-body">
												<p>There are a number of reasons why you're files are not being imported. first, double-check your import folder settings and make sure you’ve selected the
														correct options that reflects your setup. if everything looks correct and running <strong>run import</strong> still fails to properly import your files
														then what's likely happening is one of two things. the files have been imported but the crc32 value does not match any files on AniDB or there were
														errors during the hashing process and Shoko server was unable to get the hash and compare it.
												</p>
												<p>Using <strong>Shoko desktop</strong>, navigate to <strong>utilities > unrecognized files</strong> and if your files are showing up there, you can
														manually link them to the correct episode. if Shoko server was unable to get the hash, make sure no other program is accessing the files in question and
														try again by clicking <strong>run import</strong>.

										<div class="panel-body">
												<p>At this time, you are <strong>unable to mix and match different providers</strong>.

										<div class="panel-body">
												<p>While this might seem odd, this is the <strong>intended behavior and is not a bug</strong>.
												</p>
												<p>If you change your drop destination, only <strong>newly imported series</strong> will use it, any series that already exists in your collection will use
														the old drop destination. this is done to prevent your series files from being scattered in multiple places.
												</p>
												<p>If you want an <strong>existing series</strong> to use the new drop destination, you'll need to delete the series from your collection and then re-import
														the series.

												</p>
												<p>A majority of anime have at least one type of related item such as an ova, movie or sequel. using a group allows the main item and it's related items to
														be grouped together into one listing reducing multiple entries for the same series. if enabled, Shoko can do all this automatically for you by pulling
														all related series information from AniDB and creating groups for any anime series and it's related items. you're also able to specify which types of
														relations you'd like excluded from auto-grouping allowing you to further fine-tune your collection.

								</div>

										<div class="panel-body">
												<table class="accordion-table">
														<tr>
																<td>
																		<p>When adding a series and depending on the user's settings, Shoko first checks the web cache for any approved links, if there are approved
																				links they are added. however, if the series does not have any approved links then Shoko will attempt to link by series name, most of the
																				time Shoko can do this but when it’s unable to find an exact match it leaves the link empty. if a user then adds the link themselves and
																				depending on their settings, the link is sent for review and if correct will be approved allowing other users to benefit from this link.
																		</p>
																		<p>a link does not initially link individual episodes but instead tells Shoko where to start the linking on AniDB and the site it’s being linked
																				with. from there it links each episode and special that follows. you’ll see a screen similar to this depending on which community site
																				you’re creating the link for. the series name will auto-populate for you so just click the search button. most of the time you’ll see a box
																				called community recommendation, this means the series already has an approved link, click the use this button to use that link.
																		</p>
																		<p>If there is not a community recommendation that means no one has submitted a link for that series which as explained before and depending on
																				user settings, Shoko will automatically submit that link and if approved, will automatically be used. something to keep in mind, only link a
																				series using an english link. most of these sites are only in english anyways so this shouldn't’t be a problem but you’ll notice in the
																				above example there are links for the series in different languages. while they all go to the same page, click the one with the british flag
																				to use as the link even if english is not your first language. learn more information on community recommendations.
																		</p>
																		<h4>TvDB And Trakt Linking Issues</h4>
																		<p>Even if a series auto-links or the user has added the link, there could still be discrepancies with the link itself due to how AniDB, Trakt
																				and TvDB list their episodes and specials. as they are different sites they might assign episodes and/or specials different numbers which
																				would throw off our auto-linking system. here’s an example of a series with multiple submitted links. Shoko desktop - series info - multiple
																				series links to overcome this, users can add an existing link to a series, however you will need the TvDB id or Trakt slug to add the link.
																				you can get the TvDB id or Trakt slug by clicking the series name and opening the page in your browser. once added you’ll be asked to select
																				the AniDB episode and the TvDB/Trakt episode it corresponds to. because we are adding an existing link, it will only link the episode we
																				select.

										</h4>
								</div>
								<div id="community-recommendations" class="panel-collapse collapse">
										<div class="panel-body">
												<p>As previously mentioned, Shoko scrapes your files and uses AniDB to compare and download your collection’s data. however while AniDB is one of the best
														information repositories when it comes to anime, it’s doesn’t deal with images or episode summaries. to get the missing data, the episode summaries,
														images, fanart, posters and banners for the series in your collection, other sites such as TvDB, TMDb are used. Shoko is capable of automatically
														linking the series in your collection with what it thinks is it’s counterpart on the various community sites. however this is not perfect as Shoko does
														a simple search comparing only the series name leading to wrong incorrect or different versions getting linked together. so if a series has a community
														recommendation link then that means a user like yourself submitted a link, it was approved by an admin for others to use and is the correct link for the
														series in question. some series such as one piece for example will have a long list of community recommendations, this does not mean you get to select
														one but rather there have been multiple links submitted and approved for the series to fix discrepancies between AniDB and TvDB allowing your collection
														to be accurate and complete.
												<p>
												<p>
														Something to keep in mind while maintaining your collection is that community recommendations do not automatically update on the end user. this means
														that if a link is made after you’ve selected the community recommendation, future links added regardless of the link itself will not show up in your
														collection. to make it consistently checking and automatically updating your data would make this a resource intense task and slow any program or plugin
														using Shoko server. instead if you go to the community data section under the utilities tab in Shoko desktop you’ll be able to search your collection
														and display any incorrect links allowing you to manually fix them. for more information on the community data section check out the utilities page.
												</p>
												<p>
														In addition, those with a linked <a href="http://myanimelist.net" target="_blank">My Anime List</a> or <a href="http://Trakt.tv" target="_blank">Trakt
														TV</a> account will see links for those series as well and can also submit links if there is no default one. However those who do not have a linked
														account will not see be able to see these links nor will they be able to add and submit them.

														missing until someone submits it and it gets approved. If you come across a missing link you can update it yourself fixing the problem and will help us
														and any user that adds that series later on. Sometimes an incorrect link gets submitted and approved. If this is the case you can override the provided
														link with the correct link. Doing so will mark the new link as needing approval and if correct, it will replace the previous incorrect link fixing the
