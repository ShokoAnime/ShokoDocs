				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>We want to make something very clear, using Shoko <strong>will not</strong> get you <strong>permanently
						banned</strong> from AniDB. Shoko uses the official AniDB api and complies with all rules and guidelines for
						using it.
					</p>
					<p>The “banned” message you’re seeing is simply telling you that you’ve been <strong>temporarily</strong>
						banned for excessive connection attempts. AniDB will sometimes temporarily ban a user if it thinks you are
						attempting to leech data. by making excessive connection attempts that’s usually in the range of a couple
						hundred attempts in a very short period of time, the algorithm used by AniDB will come to the conclusion
						that you are leeching data and temporarily ban you. in reality you’ve done nothing wrong and just need to
						wait out the ban which can last anywhere from 10 minutes to 24 hours depending on the severity. also keep in
						mind that browsing AniDB while Shoko is scraping and downloading data can also increase the chance of
						getting a temporary ban as your creating more connection attempts.
					</p>
					<p>If you find yourself with a temporary ban, you should not attempt to perform any scraping or updating of
						AniDB data for at least 15 minutes just to be sure you don’t get temporarily banned again for what looks
						like a repeated attempt at data leeching. after 15 minutes you can try again and if you are still
						temporarily banned then you'll need to wait a couple hours. also it's import to understand that changing
						your ip address to circumvent a temporary ban can lead to a permanent ban for forceful manipulation.

					<p>There are a number of reasons why you're files are not being imported. first, double-check your import
						folder settings and make sure you’ve selected the correct options that reflects your setup. if everything
						looks correct and running <strong>run import</strong> still fails to properly import your files then what's
						likely happening is one of two things. the files have been imported but the crc32 value does not match any
						files on AniDB or there were errors during the hashing process and Shoko server was unable to get the hash
						and compare it.
					</p>
					<p>Using <strong>Shoko desktop</strong>, navigate to <strong>utilities > unrecognized files</strong> and if
						your files are showing up there, you can manually link them to the correct episode. if Shoko server was
						unable to get the hash, make sure no other program is accessing the files in question and try again by
						clicking <strong>run import</strong>.

						series files from being scattered in multiple places.
					</p>
					<p>If you want an <strong>existing series</strong> to use the new drop destination, you'll need to delete the
						series from your collection and then re-import the series.

					<p>A majority of anime have at least one type of related item such as an ova, movie or sequel. using a group
						allows the main item and it's related items to be grouped together into one listing reducing multiple
						entries for the same series. if enabled, Shoko can do all this automatically for you by pulling all related
						series information from AniDB and creating groups for any anime series and it's related items. you're also
						able to specify which types of relations you'd like excluded from auto-grouping allowing you to further
						fine-tune your collection.

				</h4>

				<div class="panel-body">
					<table class="accordion-table">
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p>When adding a series and depending on the user's settings, Shoko first checks the web cache for any
									approved links, if there are approved links they are added. however, if the series does not have any
									approved links then Shoko will attempt to link by series name, most of the time Shoko can do this but
									when it’s unable to find an exact match it leaves the link empty. if a user then adds the link
									themselves and depending on their settings, the link is sent for review and if correct will be
									approved allowing other users to benefit from this link.
								</p>
								<p>a link does not initially link individual episodes but instead tells Shoko where to start the linking
									on AniDB and the site it’s being linked with. from there it links each episode and special that
									follows. you’ll see a screen similar to this depending on which community site you’re creating the
									link for. the series name will auto-populate for you so just click the search button. most of the time
									you’ll see a box called community recommendation, this means the series already has an approved link,
									click the use this button to use that link.
								</p>
								<p>If there is not a community recommendation that means no one has submitted a link for that series
									which as explained before and depending on user settings, Shoko will automatically submit that link
									and if approved, will automatically be used. something to keep in mind, only link a series using an
									english link. most of these sites are only in english anyways so this shouldn't’t be a problem but
									you’ll notice in the above example there are links for the series in different languages. while they
									all go to the same page, click the one with the british flag to use as the link even if english is not
									your first language. learn more information on community recommendations.
								</p>
								<h4>Tvdb And Trakt Linking Issues</h4>
								<p>Even if a series auto-links or the user has added the link, there could still be discrepancies with
									the link itself due to how AniDB, trakt and tvdb list their episodes and specials. as they are
									different sites they might assign episodes and/or specials different numbers which would throw off our
									auto-linking system. here’s an example of a series with multiple submitted links. Shoko desktop -
									series info - multiple series links to overcome this, users can add an existing link to a series,
									however you will need the tvdb id or trakt slug to add the link. you can get the tvdb id or trakt slug
									by clicking the series name and opening the page in your browser. once added you’ll be asked to select
									the AniDB episode and the tvdb/trakt episode it corresponds to. because we are adding an existing
									link, it will only link the episode we select.

				</h4>
			</div>
			<div id="community-recommendations" class="panel-collapse collapse">
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>As previously mentioned, Shoko scrapes your files and uses AniDB to compare and download your collection’s
						data. however while AniDB is one of the best information repositories when it comes to anime, it’s doesn’t
						deal with images or episode summaries. to get the missing data, the episode summaries, images, fanart,
						posters and banners for the series in your collection, other sites such as tvdb, tmdb are used. Shoko is
						capable of automatically linking the series in your collection with what it thinks is it’s counterpart on
						the various community sites. however this is not perfect as Shoko does a simple search comparing only the
						series name leading to wrong incorrect or different versions getting linked together. so if a series has a
						community recommendation link then that means a user like yourself submitted a link, it was approved by an
						admin for others to use and is the correct link for the series in question. some series such as one piece
						for example will have a long list of community recommendations, this does not mean you get to select one but
						rather there have been multiple links submitted and approved for the series to fix discrepancies between
						AniDB and tvdb allowing your collection to be accurate and complete.
					<p>
					<p>
						Something to keep in mind while maintaining your collection is that community recommendations do not
						automatically update on the end user. this means that if a link is made after you’ve selected the community
						recommendation, future links added regardless of the link itself will not show up in your collection. to
						make it consistently checking and automatically updating your data would make this a resource intense task
						and slow any program or plugin using Shoko server. instead if you go to the community data section under the
						utilities tab in Shoko desktop you’ll be able to search your collection and display any incorrect links
						allowing you to manually fix them. for more information on the community data section check out the
						utilities page.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, those with a linked <a href="http://myanimelist.net" target="_blank">My Anime List</a> or <a
							href="http://trakt.tv" target="_blank">Trakt TV</a> account will see links for those series as well and
						can also submit links if there is no default one. However those who do not have a linked account will not
						see be able to see these links nor will they be able to add and submit them.

						someone submits it and it gets approved. If you come across a missing link you can update it yourself fixing
						the problem and will help us and any user that adds that series later on. Sometimes an incorrect link gets
						submitted and approved. If this is the case you can override the provided link with the correct link. Doing
						so will mark the new link as needing approval and if correct, it will replace the previous incorrect link

					<p>When attempting to connect to Shoko Server, you may receive an error message that’s similar to the

					<p><strong>Shoko Server is not responding..</strong></p>
					<p>This is a generic error message that is called when Anime Buddy times out when attempting to connect to
						Shoko Server.</p>
					<p><strong>Here’s are the most likely reasons:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Check to make sure Shoko Server is running.</li>
						<li> Check to make sure Shoko Server has been configured correctly and the settings in Anime Buddy match.
						</li>
						<li>If every thing’s configured correctly and you’re trying to access Shoko Server on the same machine it’s
							most likely a loopback issue.

					<p>In regards to #3, this is a common issue where Windows Store Apps are forbidden from sending network
