## Is Shoko Server Installed?{.page-first-header}

Shoko Metadata is not a standalone plugin and **requires Shoko Server** installed, configured and running in order to
work properly. If you haven't done this yet, [Download Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) from our main
website and use the installation guides located in the menu on the left to properly install and configure Shoko Server.

### Installing Shoko Metadata

Shoko Metadata has to be **manually installed** so make sure to follow the instructions below. This guide assumes you've
installed Plex into the default install directory, make adjustments as needed to fit your installation.

### Windows

If you haven't done so, [Download Shoko Metadata](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) and extract the zip file, inside
the zip folder is a folder labeled **ShokoMetadata.bundle**. Move this folder into the following directory.

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
```

Now you need to move the **Movie** and **Series** scanners into the scanner folder. If you've never installed custom
scanners before you'll need to create this folder first.

Create a folder labeled **Scanners** in the following directory.

``````
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server
``````

The **Movie** and **Series** scanners are located in the following directory.

``````
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\ShokoMetadata.bundle\Contents\Resources
``````

Move both of these folders into the following directory.

``````
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Scanners
``````

Proceed to **Editing Plex Scanners** to make the required edits for the scanners to work. 

### Linux

**Before you continue**, to make it easier to follow the guide, regardless of the Plex install method, we will assign an environment
variable (`$PLEX_HOME`) that will point to the base directory for your Plex content.

Below are the three most common install methods, and what you need to do for each one before you continue with the rest of the guide.

{{< alert type="warning" heading="Custom installs" >}}
If you installed Plex using another method, then please assign the variable to your own, and make sure to use the correct user when executing the
steps listed below.
{{< /alert >}}

##### Bare-metal install

Sign in with **the user responsible for running PMS** (be sure to replace `<username>` with the username of the user),
```sh
sudo -u <username> -s /bin/sh
```

and assign the variable.
```sh
export PLEX_HOME="/var/lib/plex/Plex Media Server"
```

{{< alert type="warning" heading="Check your install location" >}}
Some distributions may install Plex to a different base directory, or if you're running a custom install of Plex, then either make sure or tweak the above variable to lead to your **Plex Media Server** directory. If the above variable is not set correctly, then the guide will fail at the first step.
{{< /alert >}}

Skip to **The steps**.
##### Snap (plexmediaserver)

Sign in as `root` on your host-system,
```sh
sudo -s /bin/sh
```

and assign the variable.
```sh
export PLEX_HOME="/var/snap/plexmediaserver/common/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server"
```

Skip to **The steps**.

##### Docker (plexinc/pms-docker)

This section assumes you're using the official docker image ([plexinc/pms-docker](.)) in docker, if you're using any other image,
Attach to the running **PMS container** (be sure to replace `<container name>` with the name or id of the container),
```sh
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/sh
```

and and assign the variable.
```sh
export PLEX_HOME="/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server"
```

Continue to **The steps**.

#### The steps

1\. Navigate to the **Plug-ins** directory of your install
```sh
cd "${PLEX_HOME}/Plug-ins";
```

2\. Download and extract the latest bundle from GibHub using **one** of the following commands:
```sh
curl -L --outout - https://github.com/Cazzar/ShokoMetadata.bundle/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
```
or
```sh
wget -O - https://github.com/Cazzar/ShokoMetadata.bundle/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
```

3\. Remove the suffix
```sh
mv ShokoMetadata.bundle-master ShokoMetadata.bundle
```

4\. Ensure that the **Scanners** directory exists in the base directory
```sh
mkdir -p "${PLEX_HOME}/Scanners"
```

5\. Move the scanners into the **Scanners** directory
```sh
cp -R ShokoMetadata.bundle/Contents/Resources/* ../Scanners/
```

6\. Edit the `Prefs` section **in each scanner** using your prefered terminal editor so they match with your **Shoko Server** install,
or see **Editing Plex Scanners**>**Windows** for more info on what to modify.

**Movie Scanner**
```sh
${EDITOR:-nano} "${PLEX_HOME}/Scanners/Movies/Shoko Movie Scanner.py"
```

**Series Scanner**
```sh
${EDITOR:-nano} "${PLEX_HOME}/Scanners/Series/Shoko Series Scanner.py"
```

## Editing Plex Scanners

With Shoko Metadata installed, you'll need to make a few edits to both the **Series** and **Movies** scanner.

<h3 id="windows2">Windows</h3>

**Editing Shoko Movie Scanner**

Navigate to the following folder

``````
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Scanners\Movies
``````

Open **Shoko Movie Scanner.py** in your editor of choice and modify the **Prefs** section to match your Shoko setup. For
most users you'll only need to change the **username** and **password**. As Python is space-sensitive make sure to not
add or remove any spaces.

```py
Prefs = {
    'Hostname': '127.0.0.1',
    'Port': 8111,
    'Username': 'username',
    'Password': 'password',
}
```

**Editing Shoko Series Scanner**

Navigate to the following folder

``````
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Scanners\Series
``````

Open **Shoko Series Scanner.py** in your editor of choice and modify the **Prefs** section to match your Shoko setup.
For most users you'll only need to change the **username** and **password**. As Python is space-sensitive make sure to
not add or remove any spaces.

```py
Prefs = {
    'Hostname': '127.0.0.1',
    'Port': 8111,
    'Username': 'username',
    'Password': 'password',
    'IncludeSpecials': True,
    'IncludeOther': True,
    'SingleSeasonOrdering': False
}
```

You'll notice the series scanner has a few more options available than the movie scanner which are detailed below.

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>IncludeSpecials</td>
        <td>Files marked as specials in Shoko will be shown in the seires as part of Season 0.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>IncludeOther</td>
        <td>Files marked as other in Shoko will be shown in the seires as part of Season 0.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SingleSeasonOrdering</td>
        <td>Episodes are no longer separated by seasons. All normal episodes are put into Season 1, specials into Season 0, openings/endings into Season -1, and trailers into Season -2.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Combining Series & Movies

By default, you need a separate library in Plex for Series Movies. However, you can modify the **Shoko Series
Scanner.py** file, so you only have to use one scanner and one library for your entire collection.

Open **Shoko Series Scanner.py** in your editor of choice, if your editor supports it jump to **line 137** and remove
the following code. If your editor doesn't support it just do a search for **ismovie**, and it should take you to the
line of code in question

```py
if (try_get(series_data, "ismovie", 0) == 1 and seasonNumber >= 1): continue # Ignore movies in preference for Shoko Movie Scanner, but keep specials as Plex sees specials as duplicate
```

Remove the line and save. Congratulations, you can now have both anime series and movies in the same library.
