If you chose Shoko Relay as your Agent/Scanner combo you can skip this page and move directly to the [Configuring Shoko Relay](../configuring-shoko-relay) page.

#### Creating A Shoko Metadata Library

<Steps>
1. Add a Plex Library
    - While Shoko Server is running, open Plex and create a new "TV Shows" or "Movies" library.
    - Ensure that you have completed the **required edits** mentioned on the [Installing Agents & Scanners](../installing-agents-scanners/#editing-shoko-relay-scannerr) page.

2. Add a Folder to Your Library
    - When prompted to add folders to your library, browse to your anime collection.
    - Even though Shoko will provide the metadata, Plex still needs to know where the physical files are located.

3. Configure the Advanced Settings
    - In the Advanced tab, if you're adding a TV library, select: Scanner **Shoko Series Scanner** and Agent **ShokoTV**.
    - If you're adding a movie library instead, choose: Scanner **Shoko Movie Scanner** and Agent **ShokoMovies**.
    - Enter your Shoko Server credentials which are the only required settings.
