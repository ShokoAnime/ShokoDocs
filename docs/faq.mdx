<AccordionItem title='What Are The System Requirements?'>

While Shoko itself does not have any minimum requirement and could technically run on just about any hardware setup,
we do have some general guidelines for optimal performance.

**Collection Size:**

Shoko works with collections of all sizes, however its important to keep in mind that the larger your collection,
the more resources Shoko will need to use.

**Hashing Process:**

Hashing is a resource-intensive operation that involves significant CPU and I/O usage, as the entire file needs to
be read and processed. If time is not a critical factor and you are willing to trade off processing speed, the
hashing process can be performed on lower-spec systems. However, it's important to be aware that hashing large files
on lower-spec systems may result in slower performance and longer processing times.

When running Shoko on your NAS, hashing might also impact the overall (RAID) performance of the device.

**CPU:**

We suggest running Shoko on any modern amd64/x86_64 CPUs for optimum experience.

Users attempting to run Shoko on ARM devices such as Raspberry Pi's and similar ones will take significant
performance hits and will experience less than optimal performance. Also see **Can Shoko Server Run on ARM/Apple M processors?**
for additional info involving other platforms than amd64/x86_64.

**Memory (RAM):**

To ensure smooth operations, it is recommended to allocate at least 1GB of dedicated RAM to the system. Keep in mind
that during the hashing process, RAM usage can increase significantly. Users with limited memory on their systems
may experience slowdowns and delays in processes.

<AccordionItem title={'What About Shoko Desktop on Linux/MacOS?'}>

There are no plans to add Linux or MacOS support to **Shoko Desktop** as it is being phased out.

Several community members have had success running the Windows client under Wine on Linux and on MacOS.

## Shoko Server

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title={'Does Shoko Server Run on Linux/NAS?'}>

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) you can run **Shoko Server** natively on Linux or your NAS device.

We've created a [Server Install Guide](/getting-started/installing-shoko-server) that we highly recommend all users
to follow to properly install and configure Shoko Server.

If needed, additional support can be found by visiting our **Discord Server**.
</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title={'Can Shoko Server Run on ARM/Apple M processors?'}>
Running Shoko Server natively on these systems can lead to problems involving missing libraries and other unforeseen
issues.

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) you can run **Shoko Server** on your device with ARM/Apple M processor with
the needed libraries present inside of a container.

Please note that Shoko Server on ARM/Apple M devices is still in beta so issues are to be expected.

<AccordionItem title={'How Do I Backup My Collection?'}>
While we currently do not offer a solution to backup your database whenever you'd like, we do automatically backup
your database before updating Shoko to the latest version. If you need to restore an older version you'll find your
backups in the following locations.

<EasyTable
header={['OS', 'Location']}
data={[
[
'Windows',
'C:\\ProgramData\\ShokoServer\\DatabaseBackup'
],
[
'Linux/macOS',
'~/.shoko/Shoko.CLI/DatabaseBackup'
]
]}
hideHeader={false}
columnWidths={{ OS: '25%', Location: '75%' }}
/>

The directory for Linux/macOS might differ, if you changed it on the Docker commandline during
[installation](/getting-started/installing-shoko-server).
