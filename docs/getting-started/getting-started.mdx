Thanks for downloading Shoko!

While Shoko is a powerful tool that can greatly benefit you, it does require some time and effort on your part to fully
learn its functionalities. However, there's no need to worry because we've created Shoko Docs to provide comprehensive
coverage of **everything related to Shoko**. This way, you can maximize your use of the Shoko and your time.

It's important to note that Shoko Docs should be used as a reference guide as you explore Shoko itself. The documentation
covers a lot of technical information, which might feel overwhelming if you're just starting out. We encourage our
users to spend time actively using Shoko and refer to the docs as needed to build their knowledge and familiarity.

## Using Shoko Docs

We recommend all users complete the **Getting Started** section as it covers the installation process, and the initial
configuration. This is the bare minimum required to make Shoko function properly and start managing your anime collection.

The good news is that just by reading this, you're already on the right track and on your way to mastering Shoko.

## Additional Support

While we constantly strive to improve Shoko Docs, sometimes you encounter an issue not covered in the docs or need
additional guidance. For these situations, we're more than happy to help and recommend joining our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/vpeHDsg) server which you can do via the link above.
