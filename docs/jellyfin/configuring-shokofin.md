# Configuring Shokofin

With Shokofin installed, there's a couple things that need to be done before it can be used as a metadata provider for
your anime collection. The goal is to get Shokofin configured to your liking in a way so that you don't have to visit
the settings very often once set.

## Connecting to Shoko Server

Before you start using the plugin, it is important to connect it to a running instance of **Shoko Server**. Head over to
Shokofin's plugin settings and provide the private host, username, and password to get that connected.

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="connectingData" />

After you've established a connection to a running instance of **Shoko Server**, feel free to skim through the plugin
settings detailed below and adjust Shokofin to your liking. If the defaults work just fine, go ahead and skip to
[Creating a Shoko Library.](#creating-a-shoko-library)

## Configuring the Plugin Settings

The following will detail what each setting does and common use cases where necessary. Do note that certain options when
changed will require a library recreation for existing libraries that use Shokofin as a provider and will be indicated
where appropriate. Additional information on the subject can be found in the
[Recommendations](/jellyfin/recommendations/#library-re-creation-is-your-friend) section of the docs for
Shokofin.

:::warning Attention Windows Users
If you are running **Jellyfin** on **Windows**, some additional setup is required to ensure the
[Virtual File System (VFS)](#vfs) feature can function. The VFS is an important quality of life
feature and is normally enabled by default. More info on what the VFS is and what it means for you if you choose not
to use it is detailed in our [Recommendations](/jellyfin/recommendations/#symbolic-links-on-windows)
section. Or you can jump straight
to [Microsoft's guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/developer-mode-features-and-debugging#use-regedit-to-enable-your-device)
to enable developer mode which will allow Shokofin to create symbolic links on Windows and allows the VFS to
function. Restarting Jellyfin is required once developer mode has been enabled.
:::

:::info Advanced Options
Shokofin provides some advanced options that are normally hidden. They can be made accessible in the plugin settings
by clicking the Shoko Server version number under the Connection Settings section 7 times to enable **Advanced Mode**.
Advanced options will be
indicated using the **⚠** symbol in the sections below.
:::

### Metadata

The following settings will allow you to customize what information Shokofin will pull in as metadata for your media
entries. Any changes to these settings will require you to replace all metadata for libraries that use the plugin as a
provider.

##### Title Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="titleSettingsData" />

##### Description Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="descriptionSettingsData" />

##### Tag & Genre Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="tagGenreSettingsData" />

##### Image Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="imageSettingsData" />

##### Miscellaneous Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="miscSettingsData" />

##### Third Party Integration

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="thirdPartyIDSettingsData" />

### Library

Configure the behavior for how your media will be grouped and displayed within a library. Any changes to these settings
will require you to remove the library in Jellyfin, wait for the library to fully disappear from the Jellyfin homepage,
and create it once again following the instructions at [Creating a Shoko Library.](#creating-a-shoko-library)

##### Basic Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinSettingsData" />

##### Collection Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinCollectionSettingsData" />

##### New/Existing Library Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinLibrarySettingsData" />

##### Multiple Version Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinMultipleVersionSettingsData" />

##### Season Merging Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinSeasonMergingSettingsData" />

### VFS

The Virtual File System (VFS) allows you to disregard the underlying disk file structure, automatically meeting
Jellyfin's system requirements for file organization through the use of symbolic links. This setup ensures that no
unrecognized files appear in your library and allows you to fully leverage Jellyfin's native features effortlessly.
While this approach is relatively new and still undergoing testing, it is stable enough for daily use. We encourage
adopting this system and reporting any issues you encounter to help improve it further. Below are some settings you can
use to tweak the VFS's behavior to your liking.

Refer to our [Recommendations](/jellyfin/recommendations/#virtual-file-system-vfs) page for additional information on
what to expect whether you choose to use this feature or not.

##### Basic Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinVFSSettingsData" />

##### VFS Location Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="advancedShokofinVFSSettingsData" />

### Users

Configure watch-state synchronization for each Jellyfin user. By default, all synchronization features are disabled and
must be configured and linked to a user in Shoko Server if desired.

##### User Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinSyncSettingsData" />

### Series

Override Shokofin's global configuration or customize additional behavior on a per series basis with the
series settings. A series can be configured by searching or selecting a series from the provided dropdown.

##### Series Settings

<EasyTable :columns="containerColumns" :data="shokofinSeriesSettingsData" />

### SignalR

SignalR is a feature that allows for real-time communication with your running Shoko Server so that Shokofin has the
ability to react to certain types of events such as file events and refresh events. This means that when Shoko Server
identifies new media or updates metadata for your media, Shokofin can immediately import new or update existing media in
your library.

## Creating a Shoko Library

Before creating a library, be sure the plugin is configured to your liking as certain options may require creating a
library from scratch when changed due to how Jellyfin works internally. More information on the subject can be found in
the [Recommendations](#library-re-creation-is-your-friend) section of the docs
for Shokofin. Creating a new library rather than enabling Shokofin on an existing library is required due to the nature
of how Jellyfin and Shokofin work together.

![Shokofin - Library Dashboard](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Dashboard.png)

Let's get started by adding a new library in Jellyfin's dashboard. All important options that will impact your
experience with Shokofin is detailed as follows:

### Content Type

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Content Type](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Content-Type.png)

The "Shows" type is best for most use cases, as Shokofin will still display anime movies in the library unless
configured to separate movies from shows. If you configured Shokofin to separate movies, you will need to create a
"Movies" library as well as a "Shows" library.

Setting the type to "Mixed Movies and Shows" _will_ work, but is not recommended due to quirks within Jellyfin, and with
how Shokofin works as a plugin. Any other library type is otherwise unsupported.

### Folders

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Folders](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Folders.png)

When specifying the media library's file path, be aware that any path you give must point to a directory with the same
contents that Shoko Server sees in it's configured import folder(s).

For example, if Shoko Server knows the import folder for your collection as `C:\ShokoImport\`, and Jellyfin is given a
folder `/mnt/anime`, as long as both directories contain the same things, Shokofin will be able to identify your media.
Pointing Jellyfin to further nested folders seen within Shoko's import folder will also work, such as `/mnt/anime/shows`
and `/mnt/anime/movies` given that both `C:\ShokoImport\shows` and `C:\ShokoImport\movies` also exist.

If you intend to have multiple Shokofin managed libraries to separate movies from shows or reuse media folders across
multiple libraries, follow the [Recommendations](/jellyfin/recommendations/#reusing-folders-across-libraries) section of
our docs.

### Language and Country

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Language and Country](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Lang-and-Country.png)

With Shokofin, setting the preferred download language will not do anything unless a corresponding override was set in
the plugin's [Metadata Settings.](#metadata-settings) If a relevant override is set that makes use of the library's
language preferences, this is the value that will be used for determining the overridden metadata.

Country is utilized by Shokofin for TheMovieDb content ratings if configured as a source under
[Miscellaneous Settings](#miscellaneous-settings). If a country is not set or the
country's rating system is not available in Shoko Server for a series, a content rating may not be provided.

### Embedded Info

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Embedded Info](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Embedded-Info.png)

To prevent any possible clashing with Shokofin's metadata retrieval, leave these two options disabled as it can result
in mixed metadata and other strange behavior.

### Real Time Monitoring

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Real Time Monitoring](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Real-Time-Monitoring.png)

Real time monitoring can be enabled if you desire. Additionally, Shokofin provides a feature called
SignalR in it's plugin settings which will allow Shokofin to maintain a constant connection to Shoko Server to receive
and trigger updates for new and updated files/metadata. More information on configuring this feature can be found in the
[SignalR](#signalr) section of this page.

### Metadata Downloaders

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Metadata Downloaders](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Metadata-Downloaders.png)

When using Shokofin, it is recommended to not enable any other metadata providers for all library types to prevent mixed
metadata along with a slew of other problems from occurring. This is due to other metadata providers identifying the
media incorrectly or just clashing in general with how your collection is organized.

### Automatically Refresh Metadata

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Automatically Refresh](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Automatically-Refresh.png)

Setting the library to automatically refresh can be configured if you would like. This feature may be unnecessary if you
utilize [SignalR](#signalr) to have Shokofin refresh metadata on-demand as new metadata is found.

### Metadata Savers

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Metadata Savers](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Metadata-Savers.png)

:::danger Important
If you are **NOT** using the [VFS](#vfs), **DO NOT** enable metadata saving using NFO files with libraries managed by Shoko, and if any are present among
your media library, **DELETE THEM NOW**. The reasoning behind this is that Jellyfin prioritizes metadata from NFO
files above any other metadata provider. This results in weird or broken behavior since Shokofin is unable to
override metadata that's sourced from an NFO. Enabling this option when using the VFS will do nothing as
Shokofin will actively remove them from the VFS while leaving any NFO files untouched in the actual media folders.

Either find any files in your library that have the `.nfo` extension using your file explorer and delete them, or
run the following command in a terminal according to your operating system. Be sure to substitute the path with the
location of your library.

###### Windows (Powershell):

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\path\to\library\' '*.nfo' | Remove-Item
```

###### Linux:

```sh
find /path/to/library/ -name "*.nfo" -type f -delete
```

### Image Fetchers

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Image Fetchers](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Image-Fetchers.png)

Shoko should be enabled and set as the top-most image fetcher for all library types and categories. Any additional
metadata providers may be enabled, but can have mixed results where incorrect images are fetched. One that is
known to work without issue alongside Shokofin is the **Screen Grabber** fetcher.

### Saving Artwork Into Media Folders

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Saving Artwork](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Saving-Artwork.png)

When using the [VFS](#vfs) feature provided by Shokofin, it is recommended to leave this option
disabled as the artwork would end up saved into the symbolic linked file structure that Shokofin creates within the data
directories of Jellyfin. For non-VFS managed libraries, this is not an issue and can be set according to personal
preference.

### Saving Trickplay Images Next to Media

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Saving Trickplay](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Saving-Trickplay.png)

When using the [VFS](#vfs) feature provided by Shokofin, it is recommended to leave this option
disabled as the artwork would end up saved into the symbolic linked file structure that Shokofin creates within the data
directories of Jellyfin. For non-VFS managed libraries, this is not an issue and can be set according to personal
preference.

### Merge Series Across Folders

![Shokofin - Library Settings - Merge Series](/images/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Merge-Series.png)

If you are using the [VFS](#vfs) feature provided by Shokofin, this setting will not change any
behavior. For non-VFS managed libraries, it is recommended to enable this no matter what. Enabling lets Shokofin
better group your media into series that reflect your Shoko library without being limited by Jellyfin and the media's
underlying folder structure.

## Wrapping Up

Once you've confirmed the creation of your library after all that configuration, your library should be well on it's way
with pulling in metadata and getting your library ready for use. This may be a time consuming process, so feel free to
read through the [Shokofin FAQs](/faq#shokofin) or the
[Recommendations](/jellyfin/recommendations/) of Shokofin for any other
expectations and useful knowledge when it comes to the plugin.
