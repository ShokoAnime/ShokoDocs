    link: anime-buddy-discontinued
    answer:
      - Anime Buddy was discontinued due to lack of interest from the development team and our inability to update it
        on the Windows Store due. Additionally, even a simple update to get Anime Buddy working with Shoko would require
        a lot of work that we decided would be better spent working and improving Shoko itself.
