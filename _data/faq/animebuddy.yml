  - question: What Happened to Anime Buddy?

    answer:
      - Anime Buddy was discontinued due to lack of interest from the development team and our inability to update it on the Windows Store due. Additionally, even a simple update to get Anime Buddy working with Shoko would require a lot of work that we decided would be better spent working and improving Shoko itself.
