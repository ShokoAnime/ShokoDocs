								<h4>Getting the latest Shoko Server Docker Image</h4>

								<p>The latest Docker image is available on<a href = "https://hub.docker.com/r/cazzar/shokoserver/" target = "_blank"
										rel = "noopener">Docker Hub</a>. To get the image run the following in the command line.</p>

								<pre><code class = "language-bash">docker pull cazzar/shokoserver</code></pre>

								<h4>Docker Run</h4>

								<p>To run a basic docker container for Shoko Server, you can run the following from the command line.</p>

								<pre><code class = "language-bash">docker run -p 8111 cazzar/shokoserver</code></pre>

								<p>This command will run a new empty docker instance with Shoko Server installed. 
								At the same time port <strong>8111</strong> will be made available on the host to reach Shoko Server remotely. 
								At this point you'll be able to use Shoko Desktop to connect to the server.</p>

											<p>In order for Shoko Server to manage your collection, you must map at least one volume to the container.</p>
											<p>Note: You can have multiple volumes, and they can be named any way you like (/anime, /tv_shows, /media, etc.)</p>

											<p>Optional: You may also map a import volume, there is no difference between this and the previous command - This
												is just another example to illustrate how adding additional volumes work.</p>
											<p>Note: You can have multiple volumes, and they can be named any way you like (also try: /downloads,

									<p>Putting everything together will get us the following configuration</p>

								<pre><code class = "language-bash">docker run -d --name shokoserver --restart always -p 8111:8111/tcp -v "/path/to/shoko/settings:/home/shoko/.shoko" -v "/path/to/anime:/anime" -v "/path/to/import:/import" cazzar/shokoserver</code></pre>
								<p>This will provide you a Docker Shoko Server instance that runs in the background with persistent configuration, as well as expose it on your server to connect with Shoko Desktop / WebUI.</p>

								<p>Note: If you run the Docker container as any other <strong>uid/gid other than the default Shoko user </strong> see the <a

						<p>Since Shoko Server for Linux runs without a graphical interface configurations must be made to the configuration file directly.
							Please note that the configurations shown below are the minimum required configurations needed to start the server. Not all
							configurable options are defined below. The default settings.json is stored within the image. When Shoko Server for Linux is started
							for the first time, it checks for the presence of settings.json. If it does not exist, it will copy the default one from the image.
							If at any time you need to reset the configuration back to the default settings, shut down Shoko Server for Linux and delete the
							settings.json file. To create the settings.json file, start Shoko Server for Linux.</p>

							<h4 class = "alert-heading">Concerning MySQL and SQL Server</h4>
							<p>Previously, Shoko did support both MySQL and SQL Server as possible database options due to an issue regarding some issues when
								using SQLite with a large collection. Starting with <strong>Version 3.6</strong>, we've been steadily making improvements to
								address this issue that the benefits once provided by MySQL and SQL Server are negligible. To that end support for MySQL and SQL
								Server as a database option has been deprecated.</p>

							<p>Users who are currently using either MySQL or SQL Server can still edit their database information by directly editing <strong>settings.json</strong>
								located in the configuration folder defined in the docker run command.</p>
