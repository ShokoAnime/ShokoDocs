		<h2 id="why-sqlite">Why SQLite</h2>
		<p>SQLite is a lightweight database engine that is portable and free.  It requires no database configuration and
			Shoko handles the need to run a seperate database server.
		</p>

		<p>While SQLite is the easiest of the three database types to setup with it’s one-click setup. If your collection
			contains 200 or more series, you will start to experience a lot of issues including slow response times and
			program lockups when Shoko attempts to access your collection via your SQLite database. In regards to how Shoko
			uses the database, it’s simply not designed for large collections. SQLite also has difficulty with handling
			multiple operations which increases the wait time between operations which overall increase your wait time when
			accessing your collection. It is therefore recommended that you consider using another database option when dealing
			with a collection that contains 200 or more series.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sqlite-install">SQLite Installation</h2>
		<p>No requirements are needed to perform a SQLite Installation. If you believe your collection will contain less than 200 series,
			you may continue with the installation of Shoko Server.
		</p>
		<p>If you have encountered an issue and wish to reset your SQLite database, then it is as simple as deleting the JMMServer.db3 file.</p>
