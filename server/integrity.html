		<h1>Shoko Server - Integrity Tab</h1>
		<p>The Integrity Tab checks the hash values of the files in your collection against their original hash value when
			first imported to detect corrupted files.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>A <strong>Integrity Check</strong> allows you to scan your <strong>Import Folders</strong> for possible file
					corruption. Any Import Folders you add to a <strong>Integrity Check</strong> will have their files rehashed
					with the new value compared to the original value stored in your database from when the file was first
					imported. Files that have the <strong>same hash value</strong> pass and are not marked as corrupted, however
					files that <strong>do not have the same hash value</strong> are marked as corrupted and displayed in the
					results panel below. With this utility you can replace corrupted files in your collection preventing playback
					errors from happening in the future.</p>

					<strong>Green Arrow</strong>. Depending on how big the import folder is, the integrity check may take some
					time. You can see how many files are left below along with the status of the integrity check, if you'd like to
					pause the integrity clicking the <strong>Blue Pause</strong> button.</p>
				<h3>Managing Previous Integrity Checks</h3>
