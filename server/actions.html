    <h2 id="actions-info">What Is The Actions Tab?</h2>
    <p>While the majority of the tasks Shoko runs are automatic, you can run some of the more important tasks
        manually in the Actions tab instead of waiting for them to run depending on the timer you set. Depending on
        your settings, some of these settings will only run if manually activated providing a more fine-tune control
        over data sent to the various community sites you are currently using.</p>
    <p>There are a couple things to keep in mind when manually running tasks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The time it takes to complete a task depends on your collection size.</li>
        <li>Clicking on an task multiple times will stack the task which depending on your collection size could lead
            to a temporary ban.
        </li>
        <li>The Commands Toolbar at the bottom will keep track of your remaining tasks and the current items being
            processed.
        </li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
    <p>Below are the currently available actions you can manually run, its recommend to not blindly click and stack
        multiple actions. </p>

                        database before Cloud support was added.
