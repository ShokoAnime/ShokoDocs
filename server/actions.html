		<h2 id="actions-info">What Is The Actions Tab?</h2>
		<p>While the majority of the tasks Shoko runs are automatic, you can run some of the more important tasks manually
			in the Actions tab instead of waiting for them to run depending on the timer you set. Depending on your settings,
			some of these settings will only run if manually activated providing a more fine-tune control over data sent to
			the various community sites you are currently using.</p>
		<p>There are a couple things to keep in mind when manually running tasks.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The time it takes to complete a task depends on your collection size.</li>
			<li>Clicking on an task multiple times will stack the task which depending on your collection size could lead to a
				temporary ban.
			</li>
			<li>The Commands Toolbar at the bottom will keep track of your remaining tasks and the current items being
				processed.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
		<p>Below are the currently available actions you can manually run, its recommend to not blindly click and stack
			multiple actions. </p>
