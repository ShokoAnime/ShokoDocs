				<h1>Shoko Server - Integrity Tab</h1>
				<p>The Integrity Tab checks the hash values of the files in your collection against their original hash value when first imported to detect corrupted files.</p>

						<div class="col-sm-8">
								<p>A <strong>Integrity Check</strong> allows you to scan your <strong>Import Folders</strong> for possible file corruption. Any Import Folders you add to a <strong>Integrity
										Check</strong> will have their files rehashed with the new value compared to the original value stored in your database from when the file was first imported.
										Files that have the <strong>same hash value</strong> pass and are not marked as corrupted, however files that <strong>do not have the same hash value</strong>
										are marked as corrupted and displayed in the results panel below. With this utility you can replace corrupted files in your collection preventing playback
										errors from happening in the future.</p>
