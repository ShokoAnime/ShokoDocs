		<h2 id="why-mysql">Why MySQL Over SQLite</h2>
		<p>MySQL is the mid-tier and recommended database type for Shoko users with a large collection, who intend to build
			a large collection or simply want a speed and performance boost when using Shoko. It is easy to setup and using
			our guide you’ll be up and running in a matter of minutes.<br>
		</p>
		<p>While SQLite is the easiest of the three database types to setup with it’s one-click setup. If your collection
			contains 200 or more series, you will start to experience a lot of issues including slow response times and
			program lockups when Shoko attempts to access your collection via your SQLite database. In regards to how Shoko
			uses the database, it’s simply not designed for large collections. SQLite also has difficulty with handling
			multiple operations which increases the wait time between operations which overall increase your wait time when
			accessing your collection. MySQL however is designed for large databases which makes it the perfect candidate for
			your collection if you already have over 200 series or plan to go over 200 series. While it does use more memory
			than SQLite, the additional amount used is trivial and worth the speed and performance boosts MySQL offers.
			Multiple operations are not only handled with ease, Shoko server benefits from MySQL ability to handle multiple
			operations decreasing your wait time when accessing your collection.<br>
