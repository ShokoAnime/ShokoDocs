		<p>The Import Folders tab is where you'll manage all your import folders that Shoko uses. A <strong>Import
			Folder</strong> is a local, network or cloud location that contains your anime files. Depending on how each folder
			is setup in Shoko, different options are available and different tasks for that import folder are preformed. There
			is no max limit to the number of Import Folders you can have but you are required to have <strong>One Import
				Folder</strong> in order to use Shoko.</p>
		<h2 id="how-long-import">How Long Will Importing Take?</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-8">
				<p>There is no simple answer to this question as "Importing" a file covers multiple steps that the file goes
					through which we've outlined below.</p>
				<h5>1. Hashing The File</h5>
				<p>The file is first hashed, the amount of time this takes depends on a couple different factors such as the
					filesize, your CPU and the HDD read/write speed that contains the file. </p>
				<h5>2. Comparing Hash On AniDB</h5>
				<p>After the file has been hashed, the hash is compared against AniDB, if the hash is found then the file is
					associated with the episode the hash belongs to and the series the episode belongs to. If this is a new
					series, then additional commands are added to the <strong>General Worker</strong> to pull the needed data for
					the series from The TvDB.</p>
				<h5>3. Downloading Additional Data</h5>
				<p>If the file belongs to a new series, information related to the series and each episode in the series is
					downloaded from The TvDB. If additional community sites are enabled, such as MAL or Trakt.TV then additional
					commands are added to the <strong>General Worker</strong> to update the metadata on your profile on those
					sites.</p>

				<p>Click<strong> New Folder</strong> to add a import folder for your collection.</p>
				<p>A new window will open allowing you to specify the import folder's settings. To make things easier and reduce
					the chance of making a mistake, we recommend clicking the <strong>Folder Icon</strong> to select the location
					of the import folder. If your import folders are external hard drives, network drives or hosted on the cloud,
					make sure to update their locations if they happen to change. Otherwise you'll start to receive errors and
					depending on the actions you run, the entries for those files in your database could be deleted.
				</p>
				<p>Once done click the <strong>Save</strong> button to add your import folder.</p>

						<td>Provider</td>
						<td> The Import Folder type, if you've added a <strong>Cloud Account</strong> you'll be able to select it

						<td>Drop Source</td>
						<td>An Import Folder marked as a Drop Source will have it's files moved to the folder marked as a <strong>Drop

						<td>Drop Destination</td>
						<td>Used in conjunction with at lease one <strong>Drop Source</strong>. All files will be moved and sorted
							into the specified <strong>Drop Destination</strong> with files belonging to the same series automatically
							grouped up and placed in a new folder with the series named based on your <strong>Preferred Language
								Preference</strong> setting. You<strong> </strong>can only have one <strong>Drop Destination per
								Provider</strong> and cannont use <strong>Drop Sources</strong> from a different Provider.

						<td>Watch For New Files</td>
						<td>An Import Folder marked with <strong>Watch For New Files </strong>will have any files detected imported

							files to your Import Folder.
